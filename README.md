Installation
============

Apart from Python 3, the backup script requires git (`git-core` in debian) and hg(`mercurial` in debian) to be installed. Use

    python3 -m unittest

to test that everything is in working order locally, and

    ./bu_orga_repos.py --test --your-options-if-any-here

to test it "live" without actually checking out anything.

For more information, call the script with the `--help` option.
