Installation
============

Apart from Python 3, the backup script requires git and hg to be installed. Use

    python3.2 -m unittest

to test that everything is in working order locally, and

   ./bu_orga_repos.py --test --your-options-if-any-here

to test it "live" without actually checking out anything.
